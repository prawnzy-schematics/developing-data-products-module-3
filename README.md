# developing-data-products-module-3

n this project, we developed a web page presentation using R Markdown that includes an interactive Plotly visualization. The plot illustrates the number of road accidents in Great Britain between 2005 and 2015, categorized by severity (slight, serious, or fatal).

The source datasets are not included in this repository. To reproduce the presentation, download the zipped All STATS19 data (accident, casualty, and vehicle tables) for the years 2005–2014, along with the Road Safety – Accidents 2015 dataset. Then, extract the files Accidents0514.csv and Accidents_2015.csv into a subdirectory named data.
